# Development Environment Automation - Architecture Gameplan

## COMPLETED: Consolidated Architecture

### ✅ Consolidated Structure (IMPLEMENTED)
- **Location**: `roles/` in this repository
- **Pattern**: Role-based with proper Ansible directory structure  
- **Status**: All external configurations consolidated into this repository
- **Benefits**: Single source of truth, modular, reusable, proper variable scoping

## ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Consolidated Role-Based Architecture

### Current Directory Structure
```
roles/
# Shell Environment (from ~/.config/fish/ansible/)
├── fish-shell/            # Fish shell installation and setup
├── mise-tools/            # Runtime version manager (Node.js, Python, Go, Rust)  
├── rust-toolchain/        # Enhanced Rust toolchain with cargo-binstall
├── fish-config/           # Fish configuration and abbreviations

# Development Environment (existing + enhanced)
├── system-deps/           # System dependencies and development headers
├── cli-tools/             # Modern CLI utilities 
├── dev-folders/           # Development directory structure
├── tmux-from-source/      # tmux compilation and installation
├── neovim-latest/         # Neovim binary installation
├── tree-sitter-cli/       # Tree-sitter CLI via npm
├── astronvim-config/      # AstroNvim setup and configuration
├── docker/                # Docker Engine with complete setup

# GUI Environment (from ~/.config/qtile/ansible/)
├── locale-setup/          # System locale configuration
├── base-system/           # Essential system packages
├── qtile-wm/              # Qtile window manager
├── nerd-fonts/            # JetBrains Mono Nerd Font installation
├── alacritty/             # Alacritty terminal emulator
└── desktop-integration/   # Desktop session management
```

### Role Structure (following qtile pattern)
```
role-name/
├── defaults/main.yml      # Default variables
├── files/                 # Static files to copy
├── handlers/main.yml      # Event handlers (restart services, etc.)
├── tasks/main.yml         # Main task list
├── templates/             # Jinja2 templates
└── vars/main.yml          # Role-specific variables
```

## ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Consolidated Dependency Management

### Consolidated Infrastructure (ALL INCLUDED)
1. **Node.js/npm**: Now managed by `mise-tools` role in this repository
2. **Rust/Cargo**: Now managed by `rust-toolchain` role in this repository
3. **Fonts**: Now managed by `nerd-fonts` role in this repository
4. **Alacritty**: Now managed by `alacritty` role in this repository

### Current Role Dependencies
- **tree-sitter-cli**: Depends on Node.js (provided by `mise-tools`)
- **astronvim-config**: Depends on `neovim-latest` + `tree-sitter-cli`
- **All roles**: Follow consistent variable pattern (`dev_user`, `dev_home`)

## Variable Management

### Standard Variables (following qtile pattern)
```yaml
dev_user: "{{ ansible_user | default('stonecharioteer') }}"
dev_home: "/home/{{ dev_user }}"
```

### Idempotency Patterns
```yaml
- name: Check if tool is already installed
  stat:
    path: "/usr/local/bin/tool"
  register: tool_exists
  
- name: Install tool
  # installation tasks
  when: not tool_exists.stat.exists
```

## ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Consolidated Playbook Structure

### New Modular Playbooks
- `playbooks/shell-environment.yml`: Fish shell + mise + language runtimes
- `playbooks/dev-environment.yml`: Core development tools (tmux, neovim, docker)
- `playbooks/gui-environment.yml`: Qtile + fonts + desktop applications
- `playbooks/complete-workstation.yml`: Everything for full workstation setup
- `playbooks/server-setup.yml`: Headless development server setup

### Legacy Playbooks (DEPRECATED)
- `playbooks/gui.yml`: Replaced by modular approach
- `playbooks/servers.yml`: Replaced by `server-setup.yml`
- `playbooks/laptops.yml`: Replaced by `complete-workstation.yml`

## ✅ COMPLETED: All Phases Implemented

### Implementation Status: COMPLETE
1. **✅ Phase 1**: Infrastructure (GAMEPLAN.md, role structure) - DONE
2. **✅ Phase 2**: Core tools (tmux, neovim, tree-sitter) - DONE  
3. **✅ Phase 3**: Configuration (astronvim, dev-folders) - DONE
4. **✅ Phase 4**: Integration (playbook updates, testing) - DONE
5. **✅ Phase 5**: Fish Shell Ansible Integration - COMPLETED
6. **✅ Phase 6**: Qtile Ansible Integration - COMPLETED  
7. **✅ Phase 7**: Unified Playbook Structure - COMPLETED

### ✅ COMPLETED: Centralized Ansible Management

**All external configurations have been successfully consolidated into this repository.**

### Migration Results: Fish Shell Integration ✅
- **✅ Migrated roles**: `fish-shell`, `mise-tools`, `rust-toolchain`, `fish-config`
- **✅ Created playbook**: `playbooks/shell-environment.yml`
- **✅ Updated dependencies**: All roles now use consolidated `mise-tools`

### Migration Results: Qtile Integration ✅
- **✅ Migrated roles**: `locale-setup`, `base-system`, `qtile-wm`, `nerd-fonts`, `alacritty`, `desktop-integration`
- **✅ Created playbook**: `playbooks/gui-environment.yml`
- **✅ Merged overlapping**: System configuration consolidated

### Final Unified Structure ✅

### Achieved Benefits ✅
- **✅ Single source of truth** for all development environment automation
- **✅ Consistent role patterns** across shell, development, and GUI setups
- **✅ Unified documentation** and testing approach
- **✅ Simplified dependency management** between roles
- **✅ Better version control** of entire environment configuration
- **✅ SSH config integration** for clean inventory management

## Quality Standards

### Error Handling
- Use `ignore_errors: yes` for non-critical failures
- Include meaningful error messages and debugging output
- Implement proper cleanup for failed installations

### Documentation
- Clear role README files
- Variable documentation in defaults/main.yml
- Example inventory configurations

### Testing
- Support multiple Ubuntu/Debian versions
- Vagrant-based testing workflow
- Idempotency verification (run twice, same result)
